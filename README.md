# INT1.1: Habit Sprint

Written in: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Description and Motivation

This program is a habit tracker MVP ("skateboard"). The motivation behind the project is to make a habit tracker that's as simple as paper and pen with the added convenience of being digital.

## How to Use

Access the live project [here](https://shah-a.github.io/int1.1-habit-sprint/index.html)

Hovering over a square with the mouse causes them to light up (to indicate clickability). Clicking them changes their state in the following order:
1. Plus Circle
2. Minus Circle
3. Empty Circle
4. Gray-out

Example of what a chart might look like:
